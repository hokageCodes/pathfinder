# Environment Setup

## ðŸŽ‰ No API Keys Required!

The app now uses a **free intelligent recommendation system** that analyzes your quiz responses and provides personalized career recommendations without requiring any paid AI APIs.

## How It Works

The app uses a smart algorithm that:
1. **Analyzes your quiz responses** across psychological, behavioral, and situational categories
2. **Calculates match scores** for different tech roles based on your answers
3. **Generates personalized recommendations** with reasoning and learning resources
4. **Provides fallback options** if any external APIs fail

```bash
